# StupidBrowser
A tiny 90s-style web browser written in Java

# Why the name?
I started this for fun in my spare time and decided that the web renderer was "stupid." So I named it Stupid Browser!

(Psst, if you change `_NAME_` in `Browser.java`, you can name it something else)

# What features does it have?
```
  - 90s-tier web renderer
  - Basic navigation
  - Web searching
  - Bookmarks
  - File downloading
  - Image viewer
  - YouTube playing capability with VLC
  - Video file playing capability with VLC
  - Homepage settings
```
Why not try it out?
